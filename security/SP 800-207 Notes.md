# Zero Trust Architecture
[NIST Special Publication 800-207](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf)

## 1. Introduction
The complexity of a typical enterprise's infrastructure has defeated legacy methods of *perimeter-based network security*

Perimeter-based network security insufficiencies:
- No single, easily identified perimeter
- Once attackers breach the perimeter, unhindered lateral movement

### Zero Trust Principles
An enterprise must assume no implicit trust and continually analyze and evaluate the risks to its assets and business functions and then enact protections to mitigate these risks.
A set of guiding principes for workflow, system design and operations that can be used to improve the security posture of any classification or sensitivity level [FIPS199]

Zero Trust Security Models Assumptions:
- an attacker is present in the environment
- an enterprise-owned environment is no more trustworthy than any nonenterprise-owned environment

Zero-Trust Focus: data and service protection
- can include all enterprise assets (devices, infrastructure components, applications, virtual and cloud components) and subjects (end users, applications and other non-human entities that request information from resources)

Zero Trust Protections:
- minimize access to resources to only subjects and assets identified as needing access
- continually authenticate and authorize the identity and security posture of each access request
