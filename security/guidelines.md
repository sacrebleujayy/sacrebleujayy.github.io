- [NIST Zero Trust Architecture](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf): User credentials are the only thing separating a trustworthy entity from a malicious unknown user. We should either protect users from ever having access to credentials to leak or limit the affects of leaking user credentials.
