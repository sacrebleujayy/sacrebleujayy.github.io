While trying to do the Plaid2020 CTF, I realized I was missing a lot of tools (or didn't know how to use the tools I had). This is to gather those tools, make them readily available to setup up my environment, and make sure I know how to use them at a moments notice. For now, this is mostly just a list of things I need. I'll make a reminder to add something to it once a week or month. Need to add when they'll be useful.

Some interesting topics to look for tools on github are `bugbounty`, `bug-bounty`, [`penetration-testing`](https://github.com/topics/penetration-testing), `pentest`, `hacking`, `security`, `infosec`
